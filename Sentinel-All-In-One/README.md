Microsoft Sentinel All-in-One is a project that seeks to speed up deployment and initial configuration tasks of an Microsoft Sentinel environments. This is ideal for Proof of Concept scenarios and customer onboarding in MSSP scenarios.

## What does it do?

Microsoft Sentinel All-In-One automates the following tasks:

- Creates resource group
- Creates Log Analytics workspace 
- Installs Microsoft Sentinel on top of the workspace
- Sets workspace retention, [daily cap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/daily-cap) and commitment tiers if desired
- Enables UEBA with the relevant identity providers (AAD and/or AD)
- Enables health diagnostics for Analytics Rules, Data Connectors and Automation Rules
- Installs Content Hub solutions 
- Enables Data Connectors from this list: 
    + Azure Active Directory (only available in Tenant scope version)
    + Azure Active Directory Identity Protection
    + Azure Activity
    + Dynamics 365
    + Microsoft 365 Defender
    + Microsoft Defender for Cloud
    + Microsoft Insider Risk Management
    + Microsoft Power BI
    + Microsoft Project
    + Office 365
    + Threat Intelligence Platforms
- Enables analytics rules (Scheduled and NRT) included in the selected Content Hub solutions
- Enables analytics rules (Scheduled and NRT) that use any of the selected Data connectors  

It takes around **10 minutes** to deploy if enabling analytics rules is selected. If enabling analytics rules is not needed, it will complete in around 2 minutes.
